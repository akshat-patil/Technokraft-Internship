During my Data Science internship, I gained valuable experience in mastering the Python programming language and key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, seaborn, and Tableau for data visualization techniques.

During my internship, I worked with my fellow interns on a group project that centered around a loan prediction database in which we conducted extensive data analysis and implemented machine learning techniques to create a model that predicts whether a bank should grant a loan to a customer based on various database variables.
